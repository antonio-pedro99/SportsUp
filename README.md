## Event Management(TODO)
    1. Check if the user is already a player of the game, if so when the user clicks on the fab, 
        the app would remove the user from that event(ask confirmation)
    2. Check if the players required number is met, if so do not allow rvsp
    3. Improve firebase data: waiting room count badge
    4. Improve confirm RSVP: when the user click on a waiter, a dialog should be shown to the host
        the host will check all the info about the waiter and have option to accept or reject.
    5. Notifications
    6. Improve time, the start time should be greater than the end time
    7. Games that was not marked as completed and the timing is already over should be removed.
